To accomplish this, we analyzed the data from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) Study, which is the first large-scale, randomized trial to show that cognitive training improves cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults up to 5 years and to show evidence of transfer of that training to daily function."

BART is particularly powerful for handling complex regression and classification problems, offering robust insights where traditional models often fall short.\nTo bring BART’s capabilities to life, we created an interactive website that guides visitors through the model’s theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and real-world applications. With case studies and hands-on examples, the site demonstrates BART’s effectiveness and versatility, providing an accessible resource for anyone interested in advanced statistical modeling."

To tackle the challenge presented by large and sparse user-item matrices in collaborative filtering for recommendation systems, we leveraged advanced techniques such as Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) and Cosine Similarity using MoiveLens Latest Dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstration of Matrix Completion Method\n\n\n\n\nThrough our efforts, we successfully built a personalized recommendation system that harnessed user ratings and the ratings of similar users. This involved employing SVT and Nuclear Norm for matrix completion and utilizing Cosine Similarity to compute user similarity. As a result, our system delivered highly accurate and reliable recommendations that outperformed baseline methods, as measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Recommended Films and Corresponding Cosine Similarity Scores For User 3"

    "text": "You can explore our project materials through the GitHub repository and our detailed project report.\n\nThe ClustVarSelect package represents a significant advancement in feature selection for high-dimensional biological data analysis. Our implementation combines power k-means clustering with Bregman divergences and sparse manifold decomposition (SMD) to identify discriminative features in single-cell RNA sequencing data. The package offers improved clustering robustness through adaptive annealing schemes and supports multiple data formats commonly used in bioinformatics workflows.\nKey innovations include:\n\nIntegration of power k-means with various Bregman divergences (Euclidean, KL, Itakura-Saito, logistic) for outlier resilience\nEntropy-based (decision trees) and maximum margin (SVM) classification\nEfficient parallel processing for large-scale datasets\nCompatibility with sparse matrices, SingleCellExperiment, and Seurat objects\nComprehensive visualization and analysis tools\n\n\nKey Results\n\nSynthetic Data Performance\nTesting on synthetic datasets with varying sample sizes, feature counts, cluster numbers, and noise levels demonstrated that our Bregman power K-means implementation consistently outperformed regular K-means clustering. The improvement was particularly notable when dealing with:\n\nIncreased cluster numbers\nHigher noise levels\nGreater outlier proportions\n\n\n\nPBMC-3K Dataset Analysis\nOn the gold-standard PBMC-3K dataset, our implementation showed several key advantages:\n\nImproved Clustering: The Bregman power K-means produced clustering results more consistent with Seurat’s established output compared to regular K-means.\nEnhanced Feature Selection: The SMD algorithm selected more marker genes than Seurat’s standard approach, demonstrating superior biological relevance.\nBiological Significance: Pathway enrichment analysis of SMD-selected features revealed meaningful immune pathways, aligning with the expected biology of peripheral blood samples.\n\n\n\nLarge-Scale Application\nTesting on a monkey single-cell atlas (56,636 cells across three developmental stages) revealed:\n\nThe Euclidean version of Bregman power k-means successfully identified major cell types\nProcessing time was approximately 3 minutes for this large dataset\nWhile effective for clustering, the SMD component showed computational scaling challenges with larger datasets\n\nThis project was developed in collaboration with Zhiyuan Yu and Adrian Con Garcia, combining expertise in computational biology, statistical methods, and software development to create a robust tool for modern single-cell analysis."

To accomplish this, we analyzed a dataset obtained from the National Archive of Data on Arts & Culture, consisting of 3,447 adults with diverse demographics and socioeconomic backgrounds in the United States.\nWe constructed a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) graph to capture the causal relationship between variables, drawing upon extensive background research and expert knowledge. This graph allowed us to identify the minimal set of sufficient conditions for the exchangeability, which included the following listed variables. By considering these factors, we aimed to minimize bias and confounding variables in our analysis.\n\nAGE4: A categorical variable includes 4 age levels (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+)\nQ9: Industry: Includes 20 categories of job industry\nEDUC: Include 14 categories of education level\nINCOME: Include 18 categories of income level\nINTERNET: Whether people has access to internet or not\nQ2_: Personality: Quantitative variables mutated to capture of personality related to creativity\n\n\nTo estimate the average causal effect (ACE), we employed two different models: Outcome Regression and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) via Random Forest. Through these models, we were able to reveal a strong and statistically significant positive relationship between the treatment variable (self-perception of creativity) and participation in the arts. The obtained results indicated a p-value of 7.77e-11 and all positive confidence intervals, further supporting the existence of a positive causal relationship.\n\nWe then conducted a sensitivity analysis to ensure the robustness and validity of our findings. This analysis allowed us to evaluate the impact of varying unmeasured confounding variables on our results. The stability and validity of the estimates were confirmed, reaffirming the positive causal relationship between self-perception of creativity and participation in the arts."

    "text": "During my research internship in Bosnakovski Lab in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Minnesota, I focused on investigating genes encoding surface proteins related to CIC-DUX4 sarcoma (CDS), a rare and aggressive pediatric cancer with a median survival of less than two years.\nThroughout my research, I conducted Differential Experssion analysis on generated cell lines and tumor samples using DESeq2 and texima packages. This analytical approach enabled the identification of genes exhibiting altered expression levels. The multiple test correction was undertaken using the Benjamini and Hochberg method, with a stringent criterion of adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. I also crafted impactful visual aids, including heatmaps, volcano plots, and waterfall plots. These tools played a pivotal role in conveying the intricacies of gene expression patterns, making the research findings accessible and comprehensible to a broader audience. One of the highlights of this research endeavor was the identification of a subset of 19 genes, characterized by their dual attributes: inclusion in the surfaceome gene repertoire and consistent differential expression across cell lines following iP300w treatment. These genes represent a promising next step for further exploration and potential antibody development to CDS.\nI was honored to present this study at the Masonic Cancer Center Research Symposium 2023 and 2024 Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM). Here is my poster."
