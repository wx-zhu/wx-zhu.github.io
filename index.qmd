## About Wenxuan

Hi, I'm Wenxuan Zhu (<a href="https://namedrop.io/wenxuanzhu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pronunciation</a>).  <br>

I am a Biostatistics MS student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Previously, I graduated from Macalester College with a major in Statistics and a minor in Economics. <br>

I'm passionate about using data to address societal challenges and have enjoyed applying statistical methods across diverse fields, including public health, social sciences, and machine learning.

##  A little more about Me

However, what I cherish most is the constant exploration of my interests and the pure joy that comes with it! :)
