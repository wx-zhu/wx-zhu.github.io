In collaboration with Eric Wang, we conducted a comprehensive assessment to explore the influence of speed-processing training on older adults. To accomplish this, we analyzed the data from the [Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934012/), which is the first large-scale, randomized trial to show that cognitive training improves cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults up to 5 years and to show evidence of transfer of that training to daily function.
