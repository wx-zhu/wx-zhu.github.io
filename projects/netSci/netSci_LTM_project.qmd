title: "Linear Threshold Model and Simulation on Random Graphs"
description: |
  Curious about how a single idea can ripple through a network, sparking trends and shaping behaviors? The Linear Threshold Model (LTM) explores how influence spreads through networks, mapping out how individuals adopt new ideas based on their friends' choices.

This independent project involves an in-depth exploration and implementation of the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), a key framework in social network analysis and influence propagation. The model predicts how behaviors, ideas, or information spread through networks based on individual thresholds influenced by peers. The project includes theoretical foundations, simulation techniques using Shiny App, and visualizations to illustrate propagation dynamics in complex networks.
