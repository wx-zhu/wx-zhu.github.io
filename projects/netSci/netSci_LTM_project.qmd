This independent project involves an in-depth exploration and implementation of the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), a key framework in social network analysis and influence propagation. The model predicts how behaviors, ideas, or information spread through networks based on individual thresholds influenced by peers. The project includes theoretical foundations, simulation techniques, and visualizations to illustrate propagation dynamics in complex networks.
